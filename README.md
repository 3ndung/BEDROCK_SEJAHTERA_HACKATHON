# BEDROCK_SEJAHTERA_HACKATHON
Team Sejahtera Hackathon 

We are implementing LLMs and embeddings on AWS Bedrock to accelerate time-to-market and streamline operations. By reducing the traditional three-layer support structure to a single layer, we aim to empower L1/helpdesk teams with direct solutions for resolving daily issues efficiently. This transformation will not only enhance productivity but also improve the overall support experience for both teams and end users.
